# The `benchmark block` command

The whole benchmarking process in Substrate aims to predict the resource usage of a block before executing it.  
This command measures how accurate this prediction is.  
It executes a specific historic block and compares its actual resource usage to the prediction.  

In the following it will be explained once for Polkadot and once for Substrate.

<sup>(Also works for Kusama, Westend and Rococo)</sup>


Suppose you have either a synced Polkadot node or downloaded a snapshot from Polkachu.
You need to know which block
